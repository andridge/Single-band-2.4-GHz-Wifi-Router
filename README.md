Specifications
Medium-Speed Connectivity: Achieve reliable wireless speeds of 130Mbps in real-world scenarios through 802.11 b/g/n standards (Wi-Fi 4).
Signal Strength: Maintain a strong wireless signal with a power output of 20dBm or 100mW for extended coverage.
Memory and Processing Power: Facilitate firmware upgrades and manage concurrent connections by offering expandable flash memory (from 4MB to 16MB) and RAM (from 32MB to 64MB) preferable to accommodate the firmware as well as multiple device connectivity..
Versatile Connectivity: Provide a USB 2.0 port for High-Speed devices and accommodate Full/Low-Speed devices through an external High-Speed hub.
User-Friendly Power Management: Enable operation via a micro-USB socket for convenient and accessible power supply options.
Radio Bands: Single-band (2.4 GHz).
Limitations
Limited to 802.11n, which restricts its maximum speed to 150 Mbps, suitable for basic to moderate wireless needs.
Operates in a single band (2.4 GHz), potentially leading to more crowded frequencies and interference in environments with many wireless devices.
Lack of MU-MIMO support restricts simultaneous data transmission to only one device at a time, impacting overall network efficiency in dense or multi-device environments.
Lacks an antenna although it's integratable.
